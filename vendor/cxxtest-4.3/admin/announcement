We are pleased to announce the updated release of CxxTest 4.3.  CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible form of test discovery.

This release resolves the following issues:

 - Changes to assess code coverage of the cxxtestgen command
 - Standardizing C++ file formats (using astyle)
 - Bug fixes that led to the test runner hanging
 - Adding special assertions for floating point values
 - Added date to XML output
 - Added support for comparison of C strings

See the CxxTest Home Page (http://cxxtest.com) for documentation and download instructions.

Enjoy!
